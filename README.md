# Have you heard of [Cookie Clicker?](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454400/Cookie_Clicker/)

- You bake cookies, to buy upgrades, to bake even more cookies.
- Once you reach a certain threshold of cookies baked, you can ["ascend"](https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Ascension) to restart the run, but gain permanent boosts and heavenly upgrades.
- There is an [achievement](https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Endless_cycle) for ascending **1000** times.
- At a certain point in progression, ascending a fresh run only takes maybe 10-20 seconds, or less if you are very strategic. But this can still add up to hours of grinding the same simple series of clicks repeatedly, so...

I learned AutoHotKey at a basic level and wrote a script to automate this. Hooray.
